# RIPIS-AI  
**Real-Time Interview Practice Intelligence System**  
(PS-2 | Prototype Submission)

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Problem Statement PS-2 focuses on the lack of effective, real-time interview practice platforms that can help candidates improve their communication, confidence, and problem-solving skills in a simulated interview environment. Existing solutions are either static, costly, or lack real-time interaction and feedback.

## 💡 Solution Overview
RIPIS-AI is a web-based prototype designed to provide a real-time interview practice environment. The system allows users to simulate interview scenarios, interact with questions, and receive structured responses, helping them prepare more effectively for real-world interviews.

The solution focuses on simplicity, usability, and real-time interaction, making interview preparation more accessible and practical.

## ⚙️ Prototype Status (Round-1)
This repository contains a **functional prototype** developed for Round-1 submission.

### Implemented Features:
- Basic web-based interface for interview practice  
- Core flow demonstrating real-time interaction  
- Structured handling of interview questions and responses  
- Deployed working prototype for demonstration  

### Out of Scope (Planned for Future):
- User authentication and profiles  
- Advanced AI-based feedback and analytics  
- Performance tracking and reports  
- Scalability and optimization  

## 🧠 How the System Works
1. User accesses the web application  
2. Interview questions are presented through the interface  
3. User responds in real-time  
4. System processes the interaction and displays output  

This prototype demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed solution.
